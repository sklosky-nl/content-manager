🚀 **New: Nova Labs Events & Reservations Display System**

We've set up a new content management system that displays events and reservations from Wild Apricot and Skedda in a unified view. This is great for kiosks, displays, and mobile access!

**🔗 Main Page:** http://xibo.space.nova-lab.org:8000/events

**Features:**
- 📅 View events by date range (today, this week, next week, etc.)
- 📱 Multiple display formats: Desktop, Mobile, Kiosk, Print
- 🔍 Filter by location, source, or date
- 📊 Combines data from both Wild Apricot events and Skedda reservations
- 📱 QR codes for easy sharing

**⚠️ Note:** The system is currently using **dummy/test data** for development and testing purposes. The data you see is simulated and not from the live production systems.

**Try it out:**
- Main page with quick links: http://xibo.space.nova-lab.org:8000/events
- Today's events (kiosk view): http://xibo.space.nova-lab.org:8000/display?range=today&format=kiosk
- This week (desktop): http://xibo.space.nova-lab.org:8000/display?range=this-week&format=desktop
- Next week (mobile): http://xibo.space.nova-lab.org:8000/display?range=next-week&format=mobile

You can customize views using URL parameters - check the main page for details!

Please test it out and let us know what you think! 🎉
